## Create a Loan

Creates a new loan for a customer.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/loans \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "customerId": 1,
           "interestRate": 0.1,
           "loanAmount": 6000,
           "numberOfInstallments": 6
         }'
```

If you attempt to create a loan with an unsupported installment count:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/loans \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "customerId": 1,
           "interestRate": 0.1,
           "loanAmount": 6000,
           "numberOfInstallments": 7
         }'
```

Response:
